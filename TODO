BUGS:
- don't update indexdb if cert can't be generated (due to missing X509Ext method in pyOpenSSL for example)
- crash when selecting anything other than unix|windows (

NICETOHAVES (in order of priority, first is higher):
- create both sets of configuration files (unix/windows)
- ability to include custom documentation in zipfile and/or attached to mail
- have a Mac (OSX) template
- option to PGP encrypt e-mail
- option to use a different configuration file (defaults to /etc/stonevpn.conf)
- have CRL patches be included in upstream :)
- if to-be-revoked serial doesn't exist (in indexdb) ask for confirmation
- option to create encrypted zipfile (using 7zip?)
- option to create: openvpn CA cert, empty CRL file, more?
- a web interface would be cool .. in Django! python kicks butt
- log all actions/output
