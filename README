StoneVPN - Easy OpenVPN certificate and configuration management

Author: Léon Keijser - keijser@stone-it.com


= Installation =
In CentOS / RedHat / Fedora:

StoneVPN is included in EPEL5 and Fedora 11 and later. Just use yum to install:

  $ yum install stonevpn


From the tarball:

* run 'python setup.py install' as root

* run 'python setup.py install_docs' to install example config and
  documentation in /usr/share/StoneVPN

* copy /usr/share/StoneVPN/example/stonevpn.conf to /etc

* Make the necessary adjustments in /etc/stonevpn.conf

* Make the necessary adjustments in your openssl.cnf (StoneVPN
  should say what they are)

* Optional: download latest pyOpenSSL to have CRL support (see below)

* Run stonevpn :)


= Custom pyOpenSSL =
For StoneVPN to work optimally, you will need to download pyOpenSSL version
0.11 or later. Get it at https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl/+download
 

= RPM =
StoneVPN is now included in EPEL and Fedora so following these instructions 
are only for those who use different distro's:

I've included a SPEC file so you can build an RPM yourself. To
do this i assume you have a working rpmbuild environment and have
the StoneVPN tarball located in ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/stonevpn-%version.tar.gz

For example

$ mv /usr/share/StoneVPN/rpm/stonevpn.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS

Build the RPMs:

$ cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
$ rpmbuild -ba stonevpn.spec

If all goes well this will leave you with a stonevpn-%version.el5.noarch.rpm
file which you can then use to install on various machines :)
